# High School Projects
A collection of Java projects developed during my time in computer science courses in high school. 

### [Glowing Particles](https://github.com/fchomski/HighSchool-Projects/tree/master/Glowing%20Particles)
Language: ```Java```  

A simple program in which colourful particles glow if the pointer reaches a close proximity. Particles are randomly arranged at startup and then 'disappear' into the backdrop once out of radius of the pointer.
