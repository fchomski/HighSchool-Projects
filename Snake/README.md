# Snake
A classic game in which a snake searches for food objects in the world and grows upon 'eating'. The goal is to eat as much food as possible without bumping into your own tail.

## Screenshots
The opening screen places your snake (black) in the center of the world, and places one food object in a random location (red).

When the file is run, the snake begins moving in a random direction. The snake moves continually in the same direction that the user presses an arrow key in, until it hits a wall. When the snake successfully eats a food object by passing over the same cell the food is contained in with the head of the snake (black), the snake's tail (blue) grows by one unit.

The snake's tail continues to grow as the player collects more food objects.
