# Run (2.0)
A platform game in which players travel through various levels to complete through the use of the arrow keys on one's keyboard. Users aim to reach the portal and collect as many coins as possible while avoiding knights. Should a player run into a knight, they lose a life. Five lives are given per level and a score is counted throughout the game. The full instructions of the game are given in an opening card at runtime.

## Fixes
This game was developed with a strict time restraint and thus has a few bugs and improvements that can be made. I hope to fix these at a later time. These include:
* Some gltching in the background image movement
* The main character can sometimes appear to move through platforms
* Score should be aggregated through all levels and displayed at the end should the user win the final level
* Consider giving players 5 lives for the entirety of the game, and not per level
